I’m a 3rd-year Mathematics and Computer Science undergraduate student at UC San Diego. I'm currently working with [prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home) in the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab. In the past, I have worked with [prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) on the properties of synthetic dataset for object detections tasks. 

In the current era of data proliferation, an increasing number of individuals are seeking access to and utilization of data across diverse domains, including social science and healthcare. Nevertheless, navigating this vast data landscape demands both domain-specific knowledge and programming skills, which not everyone possesses. Motivated by these challenges, my ongoing research is dedicated to devising approaches that empower users to interact with and comprehend data through the integration of machine learning and programming language techniques.

Ongoing Projects:

Causal Discovery for Spatiotemporal Data:

My role involves delving into innovative theoretical concepts within Deep Learning and Causal Discovery, actively contributing to the progression of this field. Presently, I am dedicated to developing resilient Causal Discovery approaches that are specifically designed to extract meaningful insights from complex spatio-temporal data with efficiency and precision.
