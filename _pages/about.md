*Incoming CS PhD Student @ Princeton University | Mathematics & CS Undergrad @ UC San Diego*

Currently, I am a research assistant advised by [prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home) in the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab. In the past, I have worked with [prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/) on 3D reasoning ability of Large Language Models. 

Recently my interest has shifted towards probing the emergent abilities—and limitations—of LLMs and AI agents, particularly in comparison to human cognition:
- **Out-of-Domain Challenges:** What underlying principles make tasks like spatial reasoning and multi-step puzzle solving uniquely challenging for LLMs despite human ease—and how can we integrate their strengths in pattern recognition with human-inspired reasoning frameworks?*
- **Tool Understanding vs. Tool Use:** While LLMs demonstrate impressive tool-use capabilities (e.g., API calls, code interpreters), do they develop mechanistic understanding of these tools’ why and how, or merely master syntactic patterns? What gaps persist between operational competence and conceptual grasp?
